# Updating COPT.jl to a new COPT version

## Updating to a new technical version

When only the technical version number changes (e.g. from 6.0.2 to 6.0.3), then
only the low-level wrapper needs to be generated for the new version. Use:

```julia
julia> include("scripts/generator.jl")
julia> Generator.generate_wrapper(VersionNumber(6,0,3))
```

This will create a directory src/gen6.0.3.

## Updating to a new major or minor version

When the major or minor version number changes, then in addition to generating
the low-level wrapper, you also need to adjust the installer. In deps/build.jl
search for the old version number (e.g. "40" and "4.0") and add the new one.

## Updating the automatic installation

In order to change the COPT version that is downloaded by the automatic
installer, you need to adjust the "version" and "pkgdir" constants in
scripts/generate_artifacts_toml.jl and then include the file into a Julia
session. This will re-create the file Artifacts.toml in the top level directory.
Check that the URLs are correct.

If the major or minor version changed, you will also need to adjust the
"coptdir" variable at the top of src/COPT.jl, e.g. from copt40 to copt50.
