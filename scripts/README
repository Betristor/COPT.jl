# Updating COPT.jl to a new COPT version

## Updating to a new technical version

When only the technical version number changes (e.g. from 4.0.5 to 4.0.6), then
only the low-level wrapper needs to be generated for the new version. In
scripts/generator.jl adapt COPT_VERSION and COPT_HEADERS, and include the file
into a Julia session. This will create a directory src/genX.Y.Z.

## Updating to a new major or minor version

When the major or minor version number changes, then in addition to generating
the low-level wrapper, you also need to adjust the installer. In deps/build.jl
search for the old version number (e.g. "40" and "4.0") and add the new one.
